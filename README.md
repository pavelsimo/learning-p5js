Node http-server
===============

An alternative is node.js http-server. It is much faster than python simple server while requiring a little bit of setup. Just 3 simple steps:

* Download and Install node.js
* Open a terminal or command prompt
* On OSX/Linux type
    sudo npm install -g http-server
* On Windows type (you might need to open the command prompt as admin)
    npm install -g http-server
